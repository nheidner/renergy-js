  ## The Renergy Tyre Recycling and Rubber Powder Processing Technology


  In a continuous process with very deep temperatures (up to -195 Â°C), the Renergy RC 400/05 processes end-of life-tyres by utilising liquid nitrogen as cooling agent.\

  Without modification or additional equipment, also numerous other rubber residues can be utilised.\

  Numerous technical innovations, the enclosed fully automatic system and the patented technology ensure highest effectivity and productivity.
