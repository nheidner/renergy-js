  ## Renergy Synthesis Gas Systems


  From waste treated and pre-dried in the Renergy WS Series, the Renergy SG Series generates a synthesis gas by applying oxygen separated in the Renergy LZ Series. The synthesis gas is utilised in the Renergy PP Series in gas engines which drive generators for electricity generation.


  The Renergy Synthesis Gas Systems consist of the following plant components:
