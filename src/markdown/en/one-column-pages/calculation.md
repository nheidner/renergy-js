  # Synthesis-gas-plant cost and income calculation


  A plant of this type costs between 450 and 465 million EUR, which is provided by the investor. The construction period after contract signature is 2.5 to 3 years.


  Household waste input required 700,000 t per Anno.


  Calculated price: 25.00 EUR/t. delivered free plant, which is to be paid by the supplier.


  Current power consumption approx. 100,000; 300,000 or 500,000 MW / Anno.

   Calculated price : 4,4 Eurocent per KW. This will be paid by the company who takes the power.

  Alternatively: Electricity compensation at 18 Eurocent per KW can be delivered; household waste to plant at 0,00 EUR / t. This price could be made variable ( up or down ) in relation to the upper conditions of input from waste and the price of electricity.


  The contract duration must be guaranteed for at least 25 years. Depending on the specific circumstances of a city or country, we may ask for a performance guarantee , which is held on a blocked account in the state of the contracting party. In the contract, we can offer a 30% participation to the respective city or state. There is also the possibility of an official and legal 3-5 % participation of a person, a company or another institution, which allows the conclusion of the contract.


  The profit was calculated at 30-40Mio EUR / Anno. With the named investment, as well as previously described numbers and facts, the participation percentage can be calculated from this.


  If a government or institution is interested, we are more than happy to forward a complete presentation portfolio, including additional graphics from the power plant.
