  heading: Generation and Utilisation of Synthesis Gas from organic waste
  text: The synthesis gas systems of the RENERGY SG Series represent a world-wide
    unique solution for energy recovery from organic waste of any kind. With the
    synthesis gas produced in the plants, generators are driven by gas engines
    for power generation. This allows, amongst others, the feed-in of
    electricity to public grids.
