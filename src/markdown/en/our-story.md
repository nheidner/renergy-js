  Renergy protects the environment and at the same time ensures win-win situations for everyone involved. Renergy is a German engineering service provider with its headquarters in Berlin/Germany.


  ## Vision


  *Renergy*'s vision of a cleaner world is directly coupled with turning waste materials into valuable commodities with high returns on investment.\

  An ecologic approach does not exclude economic success anymore. Constantly growing waste streams and amounts of end-of-life tires globally force to increasing endeavours for ecologic and economic solutions.\

  With consequent consideration of these aspects, *Renergy* started the development of tire and waste recovery systems which today reflect the current technological state of the art and, for the first time, allow a to-date unseen affectivity and profitability as well as an outstanding high yield of the employed capital.


  To *Renergy*, end-of-life tires as well as waste and residues are valuable raw material resources. Simple disposal or incineration does not comply with our vision.


  *Renergy* understands itself as system provider of innovative environmental technologies and user-specific know-how â€“ tailored to your needs and driven by sustainability.
